Title: Music
Status: published

Music is a significantly important part of my life and more than just
a hobby. I picked up the guitar in 2001 and somehow the hobby has
stuck. During college, I played and performed with a few amateur bands
Since then I have pretty much been a bedroom musician.

A few years ago, I got interested in home recording music. Here are
some of my compositions/recordings uploaded on
[soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/vineet-naik).

As a listener, I enjoy classic/progressive rock, blues and progressive
metal while being open to other types of good and honest music,
irrespective of genre and language.

I am also enthusiatic about live music and regularly attend
gigs/concerts/festivals of all shape and sizes.
