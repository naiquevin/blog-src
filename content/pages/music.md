Title: Music

I am not sure if the title of this page is appropriate. Calling myself
a musician is like calling HTML a programming language! Anyway, I have
been playing guitar since past 12 years. Although terribly out of
touch at the moment, it's still significantly more than a hobby to
me. These days since programming has taken a front seat, I only get
time to practice at home and don't play with any bands or (home)
record original stuff as I used to do when I was in college. I have a
few videos uploaded to
[youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/naikvin/videos) though. Let me
know if you like them :-)

My gear consists of an Ibanez RG350EX electric guitar, a Marshall
30dfx Combo Amplifier, MXR ZW-44 Distortion pedal, Jim Dunlop Crybaby
and a Walden D350CE acoustic guitar. I also own a "Hobner" acoustic
guitar (cheap imitation of HÃ¶fner with a hard `b`) that some how,
mysteriously sounds beautiful inspite of it's broken body.

As a listener, I enjoy classic rock, blues and metal while being open
to other types of good and honest music, irrespective of genre and
language. Some of my favourite guitar players are Joe Satriani, Paul
Gilbert, Andy Timmons and Warren Mendonsa (Blackstratblues/Zero).
