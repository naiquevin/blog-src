Title: Music

Music is a significantly important part of my life and more than just
a hobby. I have been playing guitar since 2001. During college, I
played with bands but have been pretty much a bedroom musician since
then. Somehow the hobby has struck!

These days, I compose and (home) recording stuff, which can be found
on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/vineet-naik).

As a listener, I enjoy classic/progressive rock, blues and progressive
metal while being open to other types of good and honest music,
irrespective of genre and language.

I am also enthusiatic about live music and regularly attend
gigs/concerts/festivals of all shape and sizes.
