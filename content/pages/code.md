Title: Code

I like working on side projects in my free time after work and on
weekends. The code is mostly open source and can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/naiquevin) under the
[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, which means you can
do whatever you want with it. Here is list of the more serious
projects:

<small>_Roughly in the order of latest to oldest._</small>

* [nozzle](https://github.com/naiquevin/nozzle) `[Python]`: An even
  more quick and simple way to write unit tests using nose.

* [pipdeptree](https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree) `[Python]`: A
  command line utility to display the dependency tree of packages
  installed in a virtualenv using pip. To some extent, it's inspired
  by the `lein deps :tree` command of Clojure's
  [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

* [sphinx-doc.el](https://github.com/naiquevin/sphinx-doc.el)
  `[Emacs Lisp]`
  ([demo](https://github.com/naiquevin/sphinx-doc.el/blob/master/demo.gif)):
  An emacs minor mode for Python to generate
  [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) style docstrings for functions and
  methods from the formal parameters in their definitions.

* [The Game of life](https://github.com/naiquevin/game-of-life)
  `[Python,Clojure]`
  ([demo](https://github.com/naiquevin/game-of-life/blob/master/pulshuttle_V.gif)):
  Toy implementations of Conway's game of life that runs in the
  terminal. Includes utils to download and parse more than 400
  patterns from the game of life lexicon.

* [lookupy](https://github.com/naiquevin/lookupy) `[Python]`: Django
  QuerySet like interface to query simple Python collections.

* [jquery-sticky-buttons](https://github.com/naiquevin/jquery-sticky-buttons)
  `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.com/jquery-sticky-buttons/)): A
  jQuery plugin to make buttons stick to the top of the page as user
  scrolls down.

* [jinger](https://github.com/naiquevin/jinger) `[Python]`: My attempt
  at something that any self respecting programmer is expected to
  write at least once in his/her lifetime - A static site generator!

* [PHPDbMigrations](https://github.com/naiquevin/phpDbMigrations)
  `[PHP]`: South (Django) like, but minimalist db migrations for PHP
  and MySQL applications. Even though the repo shows me as the sole
  contributer, it involves a lot of work by my then co-worker
  [Jimit Modi](https://github.com/jimymodi) when we were working
  together on Kodeplay's product Kodemall.

* [Ten-Chord-Workout](https://github.com/naiquevin/ten-chord-workout)
  `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.com/ten-chord-workout/)): A browser
  based game in Javascript to practice remembering notes in chords
  (music). The twist is that the scoring rules resemble that of
  ten-pin bowling. Give it a try!

* [GuitarJs](https://github.com/naiquevin/GuitarJs) `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.com/GuitarJs/)): A small javascript
  library for guitar notes, scales, chords. The above game of
  Ten-Chord-Workout is written using it.

* [Mines](https://github.com/naiquevin/mines/blob/master/mines.js)
  `[Javascript]`: Minesweeper in the browser using jQuery.
