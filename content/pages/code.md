Title: Code

I have been writing computer programs professionally since 2009. I
consider myself lucky to be doing what I am passionate about.

Besides work, I have some side projects that I work on in my free
time. The code is open source and can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/naiquevin). Here are a few notable ones:

* [pipdeptree](https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree) `[Python]` <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  
  A command line utility to display the dependency tree of packages
  installed in a virtualenv using pip. To some extent, it's inspired
  by the `lein deps :tree` command of Clojure's
  [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

* [sphinx-doc.el](https://github.com/naiquevin/sphinx-doc.el) `[Emacs
  Lisp]`
  ([demo](https://github.com/naiquevin/sphinx-doc.el/blob/master/demo.gif))  
  An emacs minor mode for Python to generate
  [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) style docstrings for functions and
  methods from the formal parameters in their definitions.

* [Attercop](https://github.com/naiquevin/attercop)`[Clojure]`  
  Is a webcrawler written in Clojure as a learning exercise to
  understand the core.async library.

* [The Game of life](https://github.com/naiquevin/game-of-life)
  `[Python,Clojure]`
  ([demo](https://github.com/naiquevin/game-of-life/blob/master/pulshuttle_V.gif))  
  Toy implementations of Conway's game of life that runs in the
  terminal. Includes utils to download and parse more than 400
  patterns from the game of life lexicon.

* [lookupy](https://github.com/naiquevin/lookupy) `[Python]`  
  Django QuerySet like interface to query simple Python collections.

* [nozzle](https://github.com/naiquevin/nozzle) `[Python]`  
  An even more quick and simple way to write unit tests using nose
  (highly experimental).

* [jquery-sticky-buttons](https://github.com/naiquevin/jquery-sticky-buttons)
  `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.com/jquery-sticky-buttons/))  
  A jQuery plugin to make buttons stick to the top of the page as
  user scrolls down.

* [jinger](https://github.com/naiquevin/jinger) `[Python]` <a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>  
  My attempt at something that any self respecting programmer is
  expected to write at least once in his/her lifetime - A static site
  generator!

* [PHPDbMigrations](https://github.com/naiquevin/phpDbMigrations)
  `[PHP]`  
  South (Django) like, but minimalist db migrations for PHP and MySQL
  applications. Even though the repo shows me as the sole contributer,
  it involves a lot of work by my then co-worker [Jimit
  Modi](https://github.com/jimymodi) when we were working together on
  Kodeplay's product Kodemall.

* [Ten-Chord-Workout](https://github.com/naiquevin/ten-chord-workout)
  `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.io/ten-chord-workout/))  
  A browser based game in Javascript to practice remembering notes in
  chords (music). The twist is that the scoring rules resemble that of
  ten-pin bowling. Give it a try!

* [GuitarJs](https://github.com/naiquevin/GuitarJs) `[Javascript]`
  ([demo](http://naiquevin.github.com/GuitarJs/))  
  A small javascript library for guitar notes, scales, chords. The
  above game of Ten-Chord-Workout is written using it.

* [Mines](https://github.com/naiquevin/mines)
  `[Javascript]`  
  Minesweeper in the browser using jQuery.

### Footnotes

<b id="footnote-1">1.</b> As of `Sep 2022`, I am no longer maintaining
pipdeptree. [Bernát Gábor](https://github.com/gaborbernat) and the
[tox-dev](https://github.com/tox-dev) org have been kind enough to
adopt and maintain it.

<b id="footnote-2">2.</b> This site is not created using jinger. It's
using pelican instead.
