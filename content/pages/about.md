Title: About

I am a passionate computer programmer and guitar player from Mumbai,
India.

I mostly write computer programs that run on the web or the command
line. I am a complete programming language nerd. I like to study about
and use different languages. Since I started writing code in 2009, I
have programmed in PHP, Javascript, Java, Python and Erlang
professionally and Scheme/Racket, Emacs-lisp, Scala and Clojure as a
hobbyist. (Looking forward to adding many more to the list :-D). In
general, my interests include functional programming, text processing,
command line tools, machine learning and data analysis algorithms.

I have been playing guitar since 12 years now and although I am not a
performing musician at the moment, it's significantly more than a
hobby to me. My gear consists of an Ibanez RG350EX electric guitar, a
Marshall 30dfx Combo Amplifier, MXR ZW-44 Distortion pedal, Jim Dunlop
Crybaby and a Walden D350CE acoustic guitar. I also own a "Hobner"
acoustic guitar (cheap imitation of HÃ¶fner with a hard `b`) that some
how, mysteriously sounds beautiful inspite of it's broken body.

As a listener, I enjoy classic rock, blues and metal while being open
to other types of good and honest music, irrespective of genre and
language.

I am also fond of reading books and my interests range from John
Grisham to Douglas Adams to P. G. Wodehouse. My all time favourite
book is The Hitchhicker's Guide to Galaxy.

I work at [Kodeplay](http://kodeplay.com), an Opensource Software and
Product Development company based out of Mumbai, India. Currently we
are busy building [KodeCRM](http://kodecrm.com).

If you feel you already know me from somewhere, then it must be from
one of these places,

* Parle Tilak Vidyalaya (School)
* Sathaye College
* Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (B.E Mech 2007)
* Greave Cotton Ltd, Pune
