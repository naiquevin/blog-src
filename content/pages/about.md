Title: About

I am Vineet Naik, a passionate computer programmer and guitar player
from Mumbai, India.

I write code in Python, Javascript, PHP and starting to pickup
Erlang. Python is my favourite language with Erlang coming close at
second. I also dabble in Emacs lisp (Emacs is the editor of my choice)
and Scheme. My interests include functional programming, text
processing, command line tools, web development and algorithms.

I have been playing guitar since 11 years now and although I am not a
performing musician at the moment, it's significantly more than a
hobby. My gear consists of an Ibanez RG350EX electric guitar, a
Marshall 30dfx Combo Amplifier, MXR ZW-44 Distortion pedal, Jim Dunlop
Crybaby and a Walden D350CE acoustic guitar. I also own a "Hobner"
acoustic guitar (cheap imitation of HÃ¶fner with a hard `b`) which some
how, mysteriously sounds beautiful inspite of it's broken body.

As a listener, I enjoy classic rock, blues and metal while being open
to other types of good and honest music, irrespective of genre and
language.

I am also fond of reading books. My all time favourite book is The
Hitchhicker's Guide to Galaxy.

I work at [Kodeplay](http://kodeplay.com), an Opensource Software and
Product Development company based out of Mumbai, India.

If you feel you already know me from somewhere, then it must be from
one of these places,

* Parle Tilak Vidyalaya (School)
* Sathaye College
* Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (B.E Mech 2007)
* Greave Cotton Ltd, Pune.
* Rock shows in Mumbai
* Kodeplay
