Title: About Me
Status: published

Hi, my name is Vineet Naik. I am software engineer by profession and a
hobbyist guitar player.

To me, writing code is significantly more than a profession and
playing guitar is significantly more than a hobby! So this blog would
mainly be about these two topics.

I am currently on a
[sabbatical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNuOmTQdFjA) (career
break) since Oct 2023. Previously I have worked at Helpshift
(2014-2023) and Kodeplay (2009-2014).

I stay in Bengaluru, India.

You can get in touch with me at <email>anvxiva@tznvy.pbz</email> or
find me by my usual handle, `@naiquevin` on the Internet.
