Title: About Me

Hi, I am Vineet Naik, a software engineer working at Helpshift Inc. in
Pune.

Once upon a time this blog was mostly about programming and software
develoment. Since 2015, it was pretty much inactive. As I am updating
this "About me" section, I am hoping to bring it back to life with
posts not just about programming but some of my other interests too,
such as [music](/pages/music.html) (both making and listening),
guitars/gear,
[books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24556139-vineet-naik?shelf=%23ALL%23),
podcasts, [emacs](https://github.com/naiquevin/emacs-config) (the text
editor of my choice) etc.

I can be reached at <email>anvxiva ng tznvy.pbz</email> or
[@naiquevin](http://twitter.com/naiquevin) on twitter.
