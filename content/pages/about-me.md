Title: About Me
Status: published

Hi, my name is Vineet Naik. I am software engineer by profession and a
hobbyist guitar player. I stay in Bengaluru, India.

To me, writing code is significantly more than a profession and
playing guitar is significantly more than a hobby! So I end up writing
about these two topics.

These days, I am building [captrice.io](https://www.captrice.io)
alongside freelancing/consulting as well as contributing to some open
source projects. Previously I worked at Helpshift (2014-2023) and
Kodeplay (2009-2014).

I am presently available for short-to-medium term freelance/contract
work, preferably with organizations that are leveraging Rust,
PostgreSQL, and/or local-first technologies. Here is my updated
[resume](/files/VineetNaikResume.pdf).

You can get in touch with me at <email>anvxiva@tznvy.pbz</email> or
find me by my usual handle, `@naiquevin` on the Internet.

### About this site

This site is created using [pelican](https://getpelican.com/). I am
using [my own
