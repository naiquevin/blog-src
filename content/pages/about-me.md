Title: About Me
Status: published

Hi, my name is Vineet Naik. I am software engineer by profession and a
hobbyist guitar player. I stay in Bengaluru, India.

To me, writing code is significantly more than a profession and
playing guitar is significantly more than a hobby! You'll find that I
tend to post mainly on these two topics.

I am currently on a break (from employment but not from
programming! ;-)). Previously I have worked at Helpshift (2014-2023) and
Kodeplay (2009-2014).

These days I am working on a few open source projects as well as a
couple of personal ones that I hope to launch some day.

I am presently available for short term freelance/contract work.

You can get in touch with me at <email>anvxiva@tznvy.pbz</email> or
find me by my usual handle, `@naiquevin` on the Internet.
