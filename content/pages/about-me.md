Title: About Me

I am Vineet Naik, a passionate computer programmer from Mumbai. At
present I work at [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com/) in
Pune. Earlier I used to work at [Kodeplay](http://kodeplay.com).

I am an enthusiastic [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user
and a fan of open source software. Some of [my code](/pages/code.html)
can be found on [github](http://github.com/naiquevin).

I also enjoy [playing guitar](/pages/music.html) and
[reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/24556139-vineet-naik?shelf=%23ALL%23).
