Summary: Switching from Wordpress to Octopress

_Note: I no longer use Octopress. The blog is currently powered by
Pelican, another fine static site generator._

I have been using wordpress for my blog for more than 2 years and now 
I am making a switch to Octopress. While I haven't had any
problems with wordpress, I always felt managing a self hosted wordpress
installation for a blog that's seldom updated a bit of an overkill.
I did consider moving back to hosted wordress but then decided to give
octopress a try and after I did, I found that writing posts in markdown and 
deploying them as static html pages makes perfect sense for people 
who know enough of these two technologies.

In the meanwhile I have been trying hard to make emacs my default editor for almost all 
the things ranging from writing code to taking notes to connecting to IRC. 
Moving to octopress also means that now, I can write blog posts in emacs and 
publish them only when I feel they are complete. Also, I hope that those half 
completed posts written in org-mode that somehow didn't make it to wordpress
will find their way to the internets soon. 

I know how much ever I try, I am always going to be irregular at blogging 
so I have decided to go with a setup that requires very less maintainance from my side. 
This blog will be version controlled and hosted on github. Disqus will be used for managing 
comments. 

The domain vineetnaik.me will continue to point to the old server which will be used for 
hosting demos along with a [single page website](http://vineetnaik.me).

Finally I think I should give credit to the guy who wrote this [script](https://gist.github.com/1239373) 
on github that helped me migrate my old wordpress blog posts effortlessly.

Stayed tuned - particularly if you are interested in emacs, python, django or javascript.
