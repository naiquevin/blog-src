Summary: Guitar Pro tabs for Warren Mendonsa's "Nights in Shining Karma"
Status: published

For a change I am deviating from the usual programming stuff and a
posting a music related update. This one is a guitar-pro TAB of the
title track from the album 'Nights in Shining Karma' by
[Blackstratblues](http://www.blackstratblues.com/) (Warren Mendonsa).

I started working on it a while back and had left it half done before
losing it to a disk format. Surprisingly, I found it among old backed
up files the other day and completed it. Please don't take the drums
and the bass seriously ;) and also the synth track which i have added
to somewhat emulate the effects. Feel free to submit corrections if
any.
