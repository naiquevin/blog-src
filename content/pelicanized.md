Summary: Moved the blog to Pelican from Octopress
Status: published


Just moved my blog from Octopress to
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/), another fine static
site generator.

Octopress is awesome but after some time I felt it didn't work for
me. It would not be fair to blame Octopress for this because the real
issue was my passing familiarity with the Ruby language. I couldn't
tweak and hack it as per my wish without spending much time learning
the package management and the intricacies of the language itself
(which I don't have time for at the moment).

Static site generators written in Python were an obvious choice for me
when I started looking for alternatives. Having heard good things
about [Mynt](http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com/) I tried that first. But
then I tried Pelican and liked it more, particularly for it's simple
workflow - probably exactly how it would have been if I would write
one.

This theme is my
[own creation](https://github.com/naiquevin/blog-src/tree/master/naiq). For
some one like me, having non-existent knowledge of design, the easiest
way to build a good looking site is to take inspiration from others
;-). The layout and even the typography is heavily inspired by
[Armin Ronacher's blog](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/). The colors are
somewhat lifted from the awesome
[Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) (that I use
everyday in my editor). I desperately wanted to stay away from Twitter
Bootstrap.

To migrate posts from Octopress to Pelican I wrote a
[python script](https://gist.github.com/naiquevin/4972374). The format
of both being markdown, it was quite trivial. While at it, I also
migrated my short posts about emacs tricks and tips from my posterous
blog now that posterous is
[going to shutdown](http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous).

Finally, there are quite a few ideas and topics I have in mind (and
drafts) to blog about. So looking forward to make yet another attempt
at blogging (yes, seriously!)
